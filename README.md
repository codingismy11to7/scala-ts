# scala-ts

Port some [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org) APIs to Typescript. I suppose Javascript users could
consume it, too, but doesn't seem too likely.

I don't claim any kind of ownership of Scala code or APIs. I obviously took the name of `UndefOr` from
my experience working with [Scala.js](https://www.scala-js-.org). While I've looked at the Scala source
code in the past, while implementing this library I only looked at the API docs for Scala 2.13.1 and
the output of running calls in a repl to duplicate behaviors that weren't specified in the 
documentation.
